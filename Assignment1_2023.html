          The objectives of this assignment are to test your ability to create
          XML documents that contain well-defined information and to develop web pages using HTML with CSS. This assignment will
          be developed further in Assignment 2.

          <h3 id="generated" >Warning - HTML, XML, CSS Generating Tools</h3>

          <p>
            You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use tools which
            <em>generate</em> HTML, XML, XSLT or CSS code, either from a visual
            representation or otherwise. This includes DreamWeaver,
            Microsoft Frontpage, ChatGPT, saving to HTML from MS Word, etc.
            You must write all code yourself in a <strong><u>plain-text</u></strong>
            editor such as Notepad++.
            Any assignments that use code generated from a tool will be given

        <p>
			Recent studies into the positive effects of gamification in learning show that when correctly applied, games can increase student engagement, learning, and retention. A multi-national group of instructors, teachers, and educators have come together to create a central repository to share fun games and activities for subjects at all levels, from pre-school all the way to university level.</p>

<p> Called <em>Learning Ladder</em>, site staff as well as registered teachers can add game resources for subjects at all levels of education, and under a wide range of game categories, such as video games, sports, tabletop games, worksheet activities, social games, and more.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the group has invited you, as a promising student of the University of Newcastle with web communication skills, to develop their web site, <em>Learning Ladder</em>. They would like you to construct a prototype of the web page to be launched. In particular they would like you to choose TWO of the game categories as listed above and, for each, provide a page listing THREE games. That means that, if you choose sports as a category, your page should list THREE sports in an educational context.</p>
<p>
	Note: You can make up your own categories, say for example VR/AR games, creative games, ball games, games of chance, etc. Also, these need not be real games - feel free to make up your own.</p>
		
		
		<p>
			Your task is to present these games as appealingly as possible on the web. 
	  This will involve, </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Creating an <a href="#template">XML template</a> and <a href="#dtd">DTD</a> </li>
          <li>Creating two <a href="#objects">XML documents</a></li>
          <li>Developing <a href="#web">several web pages</a> for the site.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Details of all these requirements are given below.
        </p>

        <hr />

		<h2 id="template">XML template</h2>
        <p>
			The template will be a <strong>valid</strong> XML file. The important parts here are the tags
			(the organization of the data), <strong>not the actual data</strong> about any game. 
			However, you may need to include some arbitrary data to allow your page to be validated. 
			For example, if the <em>default</em> of an attribute is #REQUIRED, 
			the attribute needs a value otherwise it will not be validated.
		</p>

        <h3> XML Specification</h3>
        <p>
As the education industry develops and further research into gamification is performed, new categories of games not currently considered important in education may receive a greater focus. For example, further research into artificial intelligence is expected to eventually lead to AI assisted games. So the sites' IT team, responsible for page updating and maintenance, will need an XML template that they can copy and use for all new categories (i.e. do not hardcode allowed categories into the template). The template will be used for your example games as described below.</p>
      <p>
		The document should be able to store as many games as required within a given category (i.e. do not hardcode a specific number of games into the template). 
			
			You will decide the tags that you wish to use to describe the games, 
			but, for each game, you should at least have element tags for the following items â€¦. 
	</p> 
		
	<ul>
		<li>Name (only one)</li>
		<li>Description (only one)</li>
		<li>Subject (only one - e.g. English, Math, Music, Web Technologies, Computing Fundamentals)</li>
		<li>Grade Level (only one - e.g. pre-school, grade 5, university 1st year, etc)</li>
		<li>Search tags (zero or more)</li>
		<li>Cost (zero or one)</li>
		<li>Equipment required (at least one)
			<ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Additional cost (or included with game)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Reviews (zero or more)</li>
		<li>The filename of a picture of the game (one or more, use a relative path)</li>
		<li>URL of a webpage related to the game (use an absolute path)</li>
	</ul>        
	<p>
			Each 'Review' tag should have an attribute that indicates the score of the review (from 0 to 5 stars). If you include only the items mentioned above you will 
			<strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. Please add at least 3 more meaningful tags that make your template different from others. At least one other tag (aside from the 'Review' tag) should also have an attribute.
		</p>
		
        <hr />

        <h2 id="dtd">DTD</h2>

        <p>
          You will also need to write a DTD for your XML. Generally, it is your choice whether the DTD 
		  is internal or external, however, for this assignment, you should make 
		  the DTD internal because it is easier to validate your XML and DTD. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Your DTD will need to describe all the tags and attributes that you used in your XML. 
		  It will also be important to use optional modifiers (+, *, ?) to indicate how many 
		  instances of each tag are allowed. 
        </p>
		<p>
			In your DTD, define at least two entities (&lt;!ENTITY&gt;) and use them in the XML document.
		</p>


        <hr>
		<h2 id="objects">XML documents</h2>

        <p>
          Once you have your XML template with DTD, you will need to make 2 separate XML documents.
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Choose two game categories and</li>
			<li> Write one XML document for each category.</li>
			<li> Each XML document should contain <strong>data</strong> for 3 games.</li>
			<li> Each XML document should contain the internal DTD at the top of the document.</li>
			<li> The DTDs in 2 XML documents must be the same.</li>
			<li> The 2 XML documents <strong>MUST</strong> have the same tags and DTD as the XML template.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr />
		
	<h2 id="web">Page development</h2>
		<p>
		You will develop web pages for the <em>Learning Ladder</em> website. You need to create the following files:<br>
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><a href="#all">Homepage (index.html)</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">About Us (about.html)</a> - Use a template such as from <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages">https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">Contact  (contact.html)</a> - Follow examples at <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/">https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/</a>. Include options for mail and telephone - as well as a contact form for sending messages.</li>
		<li><a href="#all">Privacy Policy (privacy.html)</a> - This is necessary as you will be collecting data including personally identifying information (PII) from your guests. When creating this, you may use a template such as that at <a href="https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/">https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">Terms and Conditions (terms.html)</a> - Use template at <a href="https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/">https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/</a> and customise for your own site</li>
		<li><a href="#css">Cascading Style Sheet (style.css)</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		and your site map should look as below.<br />

					<li>Use a CSS to control at least a few aspects of text rendering (e.g. colour, font-styles, text-align, etc.)</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>List THREE featured games
				<ul>
					<li>Use an unordered list or an ordered list</li>
					<li>Short descriptions for each game (no details needed, they are provided on the game category pages)</li>					
					<li>One image for each featured game
						<ul>
							<li>Use an &lt;img&gt; tag</li>
							<li>Float them to the left side of the webpage using CSS. Add box information (margin, padding and/or border) to make it look nice on the webpage.  </li>
							<li>Keep images in the <i>images</i> folder you created. </li>

			<li>A copyright statement, including information about you, like your name and email address. Your external stylesheet must place the copyright statement on the right bottom corner of the page.</li>
			<li>Choose some other tags, such as EM, STRONG, P, or BLOCKQUOTE. You can customize those tags in your external style sheet.</li>
			<li>All pages on the website must contain reasonable data (while you can make up your own games, you can't use irrelevant data such as placeholder 'lorum ipsum' text)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="form">Contact Form</h3>
		<p>The contact page (<code>contact.html</code>) should allow visitors to send messages to Learning Ladder. This will be done as a HTML form, which sends the information using a POST request to https://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi when they click the "Submit" button. The following things need to be included on the form:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An appropriate level 2 heading</li>

			<li>Whether or not the message should be considered urgent (use two radio buttons for this).</li>
			<li>Include buttons to submit and clear the form</li>
			<li>All inputs are required, the form should not submit unless the entire form has been filled out.</li>
		</ul>
						
		<h3 id="css">External Style Sheet</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Once your webpages are written, create an external style sheet (<code>style.css</code>) to define a consistent style for each page. The external style sheet should specify:
			<ul>
				<li>The style of a header tag</li>
				<li>The background image, and the font family, size, and colour for the text</li>
				<li>The style of the tags you used</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Use a document-level style for some tags, AND an inline style for some other tags.</li>
			<li>Use at least one ID and one class selector in CSS. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Coding Style</h3>
		<p>
		  Please note that your HTML code, XML code, and CSS code <strong>must</strong> be neat, indented, clear, and commented. Comments are at the top of the file, 
			stating the name of the file, the name of the author and the date the file was created. Make sure these are comments, 
		  i.e. they donâ€™t show on the web page, but only when one looks at the source code. An indentation and a clean, organized code is also helpful for you as the designer. </p>
		<p>Other than the specifications mentioned, the way you design your page is up to you. However it should use semantically-correct tags. </p><p>
		Your creation should be fully valid HTML and CSS.</p><p>
		<strong>All code must be your own work. The use of external libraries (such as bootstrap) is not permitted.</strong>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Advanced navigation bar:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implement the navigation bar as above, but using a CSS flexbox.</li>
					<li>The items should appear horizontally, with links aligned on both the left and right sides of the bar.</li>
					<li>There should be a single item for the game categories which, when hovered over, displays a drop-down menu with links to each of the XML pages.</li>
					<li>None of the hover effects should cause visible changes in other parts of the navigation bar, for example, changing the position of other links or the size of other items.</li>
					<li>Refer to the sample below which illustrates what is required for this task: (you don't have to use these specific colours and labels, the layout is what's important here)<br>
					<img src="navbar.png" alt="Extra credit navbar" width="1000" />

		<h3 id="research">SENG6051 only - Research Task</h3>
		<p>Consider the following thesis statement:</p>
		<p><em>The use of HTTP/3, published in 2022 is ultimately both slower and less secure than HTTP/2 for two reasons, first, that the use of UDP rather than TCP results in more dropped packets that need to be re-sent and a worse quality of service overall; second, that the use of QUIC removes the security requirement for a TLS handshake at the beginning of a connection, which allows malicious actors to intercept traffic by impersonating servers.</em></p>
		<p>Write a short essay of 2000 words (Â± 200 words and not counting front-matter or end-matter) critically evaluating the above statement. Your essay should present arguments for your chosen side of the argument, should reference current research in the field (peer-reviewed sources only), and reach a conclusion on whether the statement is valid or not (it might be the case that some parts are valid and some parts are not).
		</p>
		<p>Your essay should be properly formatted, including an introduction, conclusion, and references (use IEEE referencing style).</p>
		<p>In addition to the above, your essay will be marked on the depth of your research, your analysis of the literature, and how well you have understood the topic and evaluated the thesis statement.</p>

        <h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>

        <p>
          Your submission should contain a template file (containing XML and DTD), and the 2 XML files (each XML file contains an internal DTD), html homepage and a CSS file. If there
          are any other files that are part of your assignment (e.g. graphics files), include those too. You should also 
		  include a <span class="file">README.txt</span> file,
          containing your student number, a list of the files that are part
          of your submission, and references to any external content (such as images) that you have taken from other sources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, your submission should include a completed
          Assignment Cover Sheet. You can download an Assessment Item Cover 
          Sheet for Individual Assessment from Canvas
          or from <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/current-students/learning/assessments-and-exams/submitting-an-assessment">

          then fill in the details and include it with your submission.
          An Assignment Cover Sheet submitted electronically is deemed to

         <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it was your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" other people's work (or images) in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately (use a README.txt file to do this).
            Failure to do so will cause you to lose marks for the assignment.
            An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere
            will receive very low (zero) marks, and may be reported to the
            School for suspicion of plagiarism.

			The use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) is forbidden for the writing of any code or for the research task. Generative AI may be used for purely creative aspects of the website (such as coming up with games, descriptions, welcome text, and images) as long as such content is clearly marked. AI detection tools will check each file, and any content with a sufficiently high detection score will be reported to the School for suspicion of plagiarism.
